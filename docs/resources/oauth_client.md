# genesyscloud_oauth_client (Resource)

Genesys Cloud OAuth Clients. See this page for detailed configuration information: https://help.mypurecloud.com/articles/create-an-oauth-client/

## API Usage
The following Genesys Cloud APIs are used by this resource. Ensure your OAuth Client has been granted the necessary scopes and permissions to perform these operations:

* [GET /api/v2/oauth/clients](https://developer.genesys.cloud/api/rest/v2/oauth/#get-api-v2-oauth-clients)
* [GET /api/v2/oauth/clients/{clientId}](https://developer.genesys.cloud/api/rest/v2/oauth/#get-api-v2-oauth-clients--clientId-)
* [POST /api/v2/oauth/clients](https://developer.genesys.cloud/api/rest/v2/oauth/#post-api-v2-oauth-clients)
* [PUT /api/v2/oauth/clients/{clientId}](https://developer.genesys.cloud/api/rest/v2/oauth/#put-api-v2-oauth-clients--clientId-)
* [DELETE /api/v2/oauth/clients/{clientId}](https://developer.genesys.cloud/api/rest/v2/oauth/#delete-api-v2-oauth-clients--clientId-)

## Example Usage

```terraform
resource "genesyscloud_oauth_client" "example-client" {
  name                          = "Example OAuth Client"
  description                   = "For example purposes only"
  access_token_validity_seconds = 600
  registered_redirect_uris      = ["https://example.com/auth"]
  authorized_grant_type         = "CODE"
  scopes                        = ["users"]
  state                         = "active"
  roles {
    // Roles are only applicable to CLIENT_CREDENTIAL grants
    role_id     = genesyscloud_auth_role.employee.id
    division_id = genesyscloud_auth_division.testing.id
  }
}
