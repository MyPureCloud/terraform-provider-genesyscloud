# genesyscloud_tf_export (Resource)

Genesys Cloud Resource to export Terraform config and (optionally) tfstate files to a local directory. 
		The config file is named 'genesyscloud.tf.json' or 'genesyscloud.tf', and the state file is named 'terraform.tfstate'.

## API Usage
The following Genesys Cloud APIs are used by this resource. Ensure your OAuth Client has been granted the necessary scopes and permissions to perform these operations:

* The export resource calls GET APIs on all exported resource types. See the list of GET APIs on each resource.

## Example Usage

```terraform
resource "genesyscloud_tf_export" "export" {
  directory = "./terraform"
  // leaving resource_types empty will cause all exportable resources to be exported
  // export all resources of a single type by providing the resource type
  // resources can be exported by name with the syntax `resource_type::regular expression`
  include_filter_resources = ["genesyscloud_user", "genesyscloud_routing_queue::-(dev|test)$"]
  include_state_file       = true
  exclude_attributes       = ["genesyscloud_user.skills"]
}
```

## Schema

### Optional

- `directory` (String) Directory where the config and state files will be exported. Defaults to `./genesyscloud`.
- `exclude_attributes` (List of String) Attributes to exclude from the config when exporting resources. Each value should be of the form {resource_name}.{attribute}, e.g. 'genesyscloud_user.skills'. Excluded attributes must be optional.
- `exclude_filter_resources` (List of String) Exclude resources that match either a resource type or a resource type::regular expression.  See export guide for additional information
- `export_as_hcl` (Boolean) Export the config as HCL. Defaults to `false`.
- `include_filter_resources` (List of String) Include only resources that match either a resource type or a resource type::regular expression.  See export guide for additional information
- `include_state_file` (Boolean) Export a 'terraform.tfstate' file along with the config file. This can be used for orgs to begin managing existing resources with terraform. When `false`, GUID fields will be omitted from the config file unless a resource reference can be supplied. In this case, the resource type will need to be included in the `resource_types` array. Defaults to `false`.
- `log_permission_errors` (Boolean) Log permission/product issues rather than fail. Defaults to `false`.
- `resource_types` (List of String, Deprecated) Resource types to export, e.g. 'genesyscloud_user'. Defaults to all exportable types. NOTE: This field is deprecated and will be removed in future release.  Please use the include_filter_resources or exclude_filter_resources attribute.
- `split_files_by_resource` (Boolean) Split export files by resource type. This will also split the terraform provider and variable declarations into their own files. Defaults to `false`.

### Read-Only

- `id` (String) The ID of this resource.
