# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This document outlines the requirements for migrating the `genesyscloud_routing_wrapupcode` resource from Terraform Plugin SDK v2 to the Terraform Plugin Framework. The routing wrapupcode resource manages wrap-up codes in Genesys Cloud, which are used to categorize and track the outcome of customer interactions. This migration aims to modernize the implementation while maintaining full backward compatibility and preserving all existing functionality.

The current SDKv2 implementation supports creating, reading, updating, and deleting routing wrap-up codes with attributes for name, division assignment, and description. The resource also includes a data source for lookup by name and export functionality for Terraform configuration generation.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1: Framework Resource Implementation
